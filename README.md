# Devico_test_task

Here is the practical part of the Davico test task

This repo is created

#### 2
The "Xpath_and_CSS" file with locators is stored in this repository

>Task: 
"A farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all hia animals. The farmer breeds three species:
chikens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you subtotal for each species.
You have to implement a function that reads data from file and returns a total number of legs of all the animals.
Information about all farmer's animals is stored in the animals.json file. Here is an example of an animals.json file: 
{
"pig": 6,
"chikens": 12,
"cows": 21
}
Return the result in a suitable way"

My solution for the last task stored in the "task_about_animals" package:
- The "Main" class is a class where we can see the output after running
- The "Utils" class is a class where functions resolve task

I used the Jackson library for the solution.
