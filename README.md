# Devico_test_task

Here is the practical part of the Davico test task
#1
This repo is created

#2
The "Xpath_and_CSS" file with locators is stored in this repository

#3
My solution for the last task stored in the "task_about_animals" package:
- The "Main" class is a class where we can see the output after running
- The "Utils" class is a class where functions resolve task
